      <h3>About us</h3>
      <h1 class="about-text">
        At The SweatZone, we believe that fitness isn't one-size-fits-all — it's
        personal. Your goals, lifestyle, and body are uniquely yours, and your
        fitness plan should reflect that. That’s why we built an intelligent,
        user-focused platform that tailors workout and wellness recommendations
        to your needs, preferences, and progress. Whether you’re a beginner just
        starting out, someone getting back into the rhythm, or an experienced
        athlete looking to push boundaries, FitPath is here to guide you every
        step of the way. Our app uses advanced algorithms, real-world fitness
        expertise, and data-driven insights to craft personalized workout plans
        that adapt as you do. From strength training and cardio to mobility,
        nutrition guidance, and rest strategies — everything is built around
        you. But we're more than just a recommendation engine. We’re your
        support system. With built-in progress tracking, daily motivation, and
        seamless integrations with your favorite devices, we help you stay
        consistent, accountable, and excited about your journey. And as your
        goals evolve, so does your plan — because real fitness is about growth,
        not perfection.
