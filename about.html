              At The SweatZone, we believe that fitness isn't one-size-fits-all
              — it'spersonal. Your goals, lifestyle, and body are uniquely
              yours, and yourfitness plan should reflect that. That’s why we
              built an intelligent,user-focused platform that tailors workout
              and wellness recommendations to your needs, preferences, and
              progress. Whether you’re a beginner just starting out, someone
              getting back into the rhythm, or an experienced athlete looking to
              push boundaries, FitPath is here to guide you every step of the
              way.
